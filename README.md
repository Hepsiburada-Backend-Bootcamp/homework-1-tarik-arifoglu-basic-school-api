![Result with multiple parameters](https://i.ibb.co/FXhMt5R/2.jpg) 
In this example, we gave 2 parameters surname=to and gender=W. 
It fetched the students, which have "to" string in their surname and W in their gender property. 
# Important Note
The query method will look for the students, which matches with ALL the parameters, which means they have to match with all the given parameters(if there is more than one parameter).
